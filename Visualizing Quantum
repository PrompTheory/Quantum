Visualize a circle, a plain circle.
Inside the circle is one and outside the circle is zero
now you're thinking in binary. in a row of 8 circles that can be white or black, you can represent 256 numbers, now an infinite lines of 8 circles can represent all numbers known to man.
An infinite amount of circles requires memory to store infinity, which would require a CPU larger than the largest star in the known universe and still not get close to infinity

Now with quantum, those endless amounts of circles turns into one sphere
visualize the sphere as a brain with nervous system connections
although each synapse turns on or off, like the circle being black or white
the sphere is like a human brain, chains of millions of nerouns form fast different shapes and pathways firing off in different directions triggering different hormonal responses
for the brain to remain in homeostasis
if you know the end goal is to move your hand or type one action in the keyboard, a quantum computer knows the end goal or action and fires off using multiple states of ones and zeroes all in different positions
like the numbers turning on or off.
