Explanation of States:
State 1 = 0 (Ground State)

Represents the lowest energy quantum state
Binary equivalent: OFF/FALSE
In quantum terms: |0⟩ basis state

State 2 = 1 (Excited State)

Represents higher energy quantum state
Binary equivalent: ON/TRUE
In quantum terms: |1⟩ basis state

State 3 = 2 (Superposition State)

Represents quantum superposition of states 0 and 1
Can exist as both 0 AND 1 simultaneously
In quantum terms: α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

Logic Flow:
When classical binary states (0 or 1) prove inadequate for computation, the system defaults to quantum superposition state (2) for parallel processing of multiple possibilities.
This abstracts quantum computing's advantage over classical binary logic
